This is a personal project to build a command-line todo application. The main goal is to practice and hone skills in modern Python development, including project structure, typing, testing, and tooling.

## Tech Stack & Concepts

This project is an exercise in using a modern Python stack:

*   **CLI Framework:** Typer is used for creating a clean, user-friendly command-line interface.
*   **Static Typing:** The codebase is fully typed and checked with Mypy in strict mode to catch errors before runtime.
*   **Code Quality:** Ruff handles both linting and formatting to ensure the code is consistent and readable.
*   **Testing:** Pytest is used for writing and running the test suite.
*   **Packaging:** The project is structured as an installable package using `pyproject.toml` and the `src` layout, which is a current best practice.
